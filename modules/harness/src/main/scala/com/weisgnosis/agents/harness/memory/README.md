# Conversation compaction

ConversationCompactor accepts an effectful summarizer, a pure TokenCounter, and optional flush/offload callbacks. Defaults: triggerTokens=120000, keepTokens=40000, preserveTailMessages=6, maxPruneOutputChars=2000, protectTokens=40000. Valid histories below the trigger remain unchanged. Compaction prunes older payloads, preserves matched call/result pairs and protected tails, deduplicates summaries, and coalesces adjacent user messages. Retained-user provenance survives coalescing for later flushing. MemoryFlushManager, MemoryConsolidator, and runtime installation remain planned; callbacks do not provide durable storage.

## Pairing and pruning

Each call occurrence enters an immutable pending sequence. Inline results consume only eligible provider-hosted calls from their own assistant message. Remaining calls match subsequent Role.Tool observations once, by ID and by name when supplied; unnamed results consume the first matching occurrence. An unmatched provider-marked call uses the same name-sensitive local matching. Inline observations cannot steal a pending local call from the same or an earlier assistant message.

Occurrence spans are computed once. A cutoff crossing any matched span moves backward to its assistant message; leading orphan Tool messages move forward into the prefix. This preserves repeated IDs, identical parallel calls, reversed named completion, and pairs across intervening messages. It does not validate all malformed input histories or guarantee completeness of unrelated preexisting unmatched calls/results; runtime transformed-history validation remains separate work.

Older text output is pruned while retaining non-text blocks and execution metadata/state. Oversized unsigned arguments are replaced by a preview object, and their cached content is cleared. The presence of either thoughtSignature or reasoningDetails protects arguments and cached content from pruning, including malformed or JSON-null metadata values. Identity, state, metadata, protected tails, and below-trigger histories remain unchanged. Token thresholds trigger best-effort reduction; preservation rules can retain large signed arguments.

Prior summaries enter summarization once but never raw-memory flushing. A replacement summary is coalesced with an initial retained user turn, with validated provenance for later flushing. System messages are preserved. Typed hook/summarizer failures propagate, cancellation remains cancellation, and completed external flush/offload effects cannot be rolled back.

## Implementation

- [ConversationCompactor](ConversationCompactor.scala)
- [CompactorConfig](CompactorConfig.scala)
- [TokenCounter](TokenCounter.scala)

See the [test index](../../../../../../../test/scala/com/weisgnosis/agents/harness/memory/README.md), [tracker](../../../../../../../../../../docs/architecture/tracker.md), and [parity audit](../../../../../../../../../../docs/architecture/test-parity.md). Prior provenance and message-migration acceptance is preserved in Git through `6ed928a`.

## Current review acceptance

- [x] `review_fp` and `review_harness` approved the final two-file compactor hardening against `6ed928a` on 2026-09-29. No findings remain in this scope. Eight new regressions failed before the correction; full formatting, fatal-warning compilation, and verification now pass 481 core and 69 harness tests. Acceptance covers standalone pairing and argument pruning; runtime integration and transformed-history validation remain pending.
