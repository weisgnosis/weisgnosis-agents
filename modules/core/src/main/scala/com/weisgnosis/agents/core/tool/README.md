# Typed tools and path validation

Tool keeps its input/output codecs and effectful handler together. Toolkit registration and merging return Either[AgentError, Toolkit], including duplicate-name failures. Execution normalizes tool failures and defects into Error observations; interruption propagates. PathSafety rejects parent traversal before canonicalization and resolves existing ancestors through toRealPath. Canonical checks do not provide an atomic sandbox against hostile filesystem mutation.

## Implementation

- [PathSafety](PathSafety.scala)
- [Tool](Tool.scala)
- [ToolDef](ToolDef.scala)
- [ToolExecutionResult](ToolExecutionResult.scala)
- [Toolkit](Toolkit.scala)

See the [repository architecture](../../../../../../../../../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for integration boundaries and invariant definitions.
